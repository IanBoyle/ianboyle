By day, I'm diving deep into the world of front-end design, crafting pixel-perfect interfaces and bringing websites to life. You'll often find me:

🖌️ Tinkering with CSS designs
✨ Creating mesmerizing animations
🧪 Experimenting with the latest web technologies

But wait, there's more! I'm also passionate about:

🔐 Web application security

Because who doesn't love a good challenge?


🕹️ Indie game development

Powered by the awesome Godot engine!



When I'm not coding, you might catch me:

🎮 Playing indie games for "research"
🍕 Debating whether pineapple belongs on pizza
🌱 Trying (and failing) to keep my houseplants alive

Let's connect and create something awesome together! 🚀
